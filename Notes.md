# Calibration
Program should automate that. Select the total range of bands you are concerned with. Then have it automatically cycle through both a calibration of the entire range as well as individual ones for each band (unless we can just do with a lot of points over the whole range).

Should guide you through the open, short, 50 ohm. When done, save them.

# Analyze
Two modes
* survey 
Make sure we load the proper calibration.

Does the whole range so you can see where dips are. Also should analyze that and report all of the (significant) dips.

* one band
Do the band plus 50% or so

Make sure we load the proper calibration.

When it does the sweep, automatically locate the min and report the SWR as well a complex components.
